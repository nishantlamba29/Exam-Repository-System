# Exam Repository System

A platform for uploading, sharing, and discovering university exam papers, built with **React**, **Node.js/Express**, and **MongoDB**. The system uses AI (Google Gemini) to extract and structure questions from uploaded images or PDFs, supports real-time notifications, credit-based access, and features a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login with JWT.
- **Paper Upload**: Upload exam papers as images or PDFs. AI extracts questions and metadata.
- **Automatic Parsing**: Uses Google Gemini to parse and structure questions, course info, and exam metadata.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents duplicate uploads and notifies users if a paper already exists.
- **Credit System**: Users earn credits for uploading valid papers and spend credits to unlock answers.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Dashboard polls for new notifications (paper approval, rejection, duplicate, etc.).
- **Recommendations**: Personalized paper recommendations on the dashboard.
- **Search & Browse**: Find papers by course, session, year, or exam type.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Material Tailwind for a modern look.
- **Subscription & Payments**: Buy credits via Razorpay integration (test mode).
